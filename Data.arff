The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.','Saint John, Miramichi and Restigouche River NB, April 5 to May 4, 2009. A freshet in spring 2009 caused flooding in a number of communities, primarily from the formation of ice jams which raised water levels along the Saint John, Miramichi, and Restigouche rivers from April 5 to May 4.  The flooding caused damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure such as roadways.  Preliminary eligible costs are estimated at $2.0 million, which would result in a federal share of approximately $626,000.','Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor ON, April 25, 2009. A spate of fierce thunderstorms broke out across southwestern, southcentral and eastern Ontario. Winds at Toronto Pearson International Airport gusted to 115 km/h, the strongest wind gusts reported since January 1978. Power lines and trees came down across the province, knocking out power to 100,000 customers (300,000 individuals).  Embedded in the thunderstorm cluster were marble-sized hail near Parry Sound, waterspouts in the Ottawa River, straight-line winds and weak tornados in Windsor and Ottawa. In Windsor, the roof was ripped off a union hall building with chunks of roofing and shards of glass littering the lawn and front steps. At Ottawa\'s Rockcliffe Flying Club, winds damaged 18 planes. Both tornados were F0 in intensity with winds of up to 110 km/h.','Montreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC, May 14, 2009. Winds gusting up to 100 km/h wreaked havoc across Quebec on May 14. An 18-wheeler was one of six tractor-trailers pushed over on its side near Beloeil. Strong winds cut electricity to 70,000 people by downing hydro lines.  Winds also inflicted significant property damage: in Ste-Julie, winds uprooted hundreds of trees and tossed a gazebo and trampoline into the air where there were left dangling from power lines; in Alma, fallen trees crossed power lines, igniting a brush fire; in the La Tuque region, winds blew shingles off a hotel roof and dropped a street light on a home; and in Baie-Saint-Paul, winds snapped hydro poles in half and tore away roofs.','Notre-Dame-des-Prairies QC, June 28 to July 4, 2009.

In addition, lightning caused various fires throughout the city.','Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.','Vancouver and Fraser BC, June 27 to August 3, 2009. Temperatures of up to 34.4 degrees centigrade were measured at Vancouver International Airport during an eight-day period from July 27 to August 3.

In Mont-Laurier, 40 homes were damaged, amoung those 28 were rendered uninhabitable. There were no fatalities, although two people were injured and taken to the hospital. The tornado caused about $6 million in insured losses. The tornado\'s path through Mont-Laurier was 300 metres wide, but its 40 kilometre track was an unusually long distance for a tornado in Quebec and a strong indication of the storm\'s severity. Previous to this event, the last time a stronger tornado touched down in the Quebec was on the same day in 1994 when an F3 tornado destroyed more than 400 homes in Aylmer.','Winnipeg and Steinbach MB, August 14, 2009.

A super cell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 kilometres. The heat and humidity in Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared. A squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across the Great Lakes reaching southern Ontario at 15:00 EDT. This system produced powerful winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto as well as destructive tornadoes in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornadoes were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of super cell thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in parts of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the days weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. This was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp.

In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).',large,evacuation,?
